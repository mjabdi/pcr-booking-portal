                      has tested negative for coronavirus.

                        Once the sample has been taken it is sent to the
                        laboratory for analysis immediately, by hand to ensure

                        is within walking distance of our clinic. Your Covid PCR

                      The UK Coronavirus Task Force has announced that rules for
                      the current 14 day quarantine for people returning to the
                      UK from a non-travel corridor country will come to an end
                      in mid-December this year. The fourteen day quarantine
                      will be replaced with a âtest and releaseâ regimen where
                      instead of quarantining for 2 weeks, after 5 days
                      quarantine, travellers can have a COVID-19 PCR test. If
                      this test is negative, they will no longer have to
                      quarantine.
